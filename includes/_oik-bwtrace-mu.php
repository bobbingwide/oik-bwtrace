/**														 
 * oik-bwtrace Must Use version is the file that is used to implement oik-bwtrace logic as a Must Use plugin
 *
 * Using the oik-bwtrace admin menu the user can choose to make this a MU plugin
 * which means that oik-bwtrace will be activated a lot earlier and we'll be able to count more action hooks
 * 
 * For the site administrator this is an easier way of activating trace logic than editing wp-config.php
 * and it means that we can refer to real options values, not values invented from the constants defined in the config file.
 * 
 * To get the most complete list of action hooks and filters it is necessary to create/update wp-content/db.php
 * ensuring it contains the following code
 * 
 * `
 * if ( defined( "BW_COUNT_ON" ) && true == BW_COUNT_ON ) {
 * 	 if ( function_exists( "bw_trace_count_plugins_loaded" ) ) {
 *	   bw_trace_count_plugins_loaded( BW_COUNT_ON );
 *	 }
 * }
 * ` 
 *
